ðŸŽ‰ Celebrating 30 Legendary Years of Marc Mulligan at TD ðŸŽ‰

Three decades gone â€” but who's counting lines?
Marc Mulligan's journey, built with design.

Need a solution? Have no fear.
Marcâ€™s inbox is where all devs steer.

Heâ€™s the Stack Overflow of our humble hall,
And somehow, heâ€™s still answering every call.

TDâ€™s own Gandalf, with keyboard and brain,
He architects systems mere mortals canâ€™t explain.

Youâ€™ll find him in meetings, calm and composed,
While our heads explode, Marcâ€™s already diagnosed.

Raise your mugs (or your dev console logs),
Letâ€™s cheer for the wizard who still outcodes the blogs.

For thirty long years â€” no burnout, no bluff,
Just solving hard problems before coffeeâ€™s enough.

And if TD ever builds a Hall of Frame,
Marc Mulligan will lead that game.

Thank you, Marc, for being the constant we could always rely on â€” here's to many more milestones together!
